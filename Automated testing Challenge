Here are the steps on how to automate the user login process for an SDLMS application:
Identify the elements of the login page that need to be automated. This includes the username field, password field, and login button.
Use a scripting language, such as Python or JavaScript, to create a script that will automate the login process. The script will need to enter the username and password into the appropriate fields and click the login button.
Test the script to make sure it works correctly. You can do this by running the script on a test account.
Once the script is working correctly, you can deploy it to a production environment. This will allow users to automatically log into the SDLMS application without having to enter their username and password manually.

Here is an example of a Python script that can be used to automate the login process for an SDLMS application:

import requests

def login(username, password):
    url = "https://www.example.com/sdlms/login"
    data = {
        "username": username,
        "password": password
    }
    response = requests.post(url, data=data)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Login successful!")
    else:
        print("Login failed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    username = "user@example.com"
    password = "password"

    login(username, password)
